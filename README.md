I am kinda lazy to edit this, but if you are here, sure! Here is something for you

I am just a student, trying to get my degree. I am kinda broke so if you try to scam me, I mean I have no money ðŸ¥² If you want to hire me, please let me know
I am probably doing something like IOT project, class project, and stuff that I wanna do but I dont have time to do until I rmb about it while I am lying on bed

That's it
Hope you have a great day!
